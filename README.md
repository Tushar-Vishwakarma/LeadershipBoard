**Leaderboard Page**

**Features:**
- User Ranking: Displays users in descending order based on points.
- Simple Design: Clean and minimalistic table structure for easy readability.
- Responsive: Adapts to different screen sizes.

**Usage:**
Once the leaderboard page is set up, it will automatically display the user rankings based on a predefined dataset. The table will show the top users along with their points.
